User can login and check the expense history this is Create of the CRUD, we implement the CRUD first so not yet the 
data visualization 

so the login feature first 


the we loop the transactions into the homepage 


there should be a page called Finance Tracker which lead to the home page where we show the lists of the transactions which have buttons integrated edit and delete which leads to detail page 

inside the page we can interact with the page with Button(ajax behind the scene) which leads to new transactions


About the form to edit:

	the edit will be presented as an extra row inside the table where we can modify the states of the transaction, and confirm or cancel it. Behind the scene
			the button which edit trigger should be using patial view which is the form 
			the form is seperate form with an edit controller which recieve the input.

Seems like first create the U of the CRUD is not wise as the technical vision is not yet that clear. I believe the world will open up quite 
a bit after first discover how the Create funcitonize.
